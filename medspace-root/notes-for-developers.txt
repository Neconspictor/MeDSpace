When you want to build the projects from source, please note:

- You need to have installed SBT (at least version 0.13.15)

- you can generate eclipse project files by running 'sbt eclipse'

- eclipse integration is more complicated than for intellij idea (at least the ultimate version).

- Please read this article to better understand how to work with SBT:
  https://medium.com/@murphye/up-and-running-using-sbt-with-eclipse-or-intellij-640bb121e128

- The projects commons, commons_network, commons_play, and D2rmap needn't to be build manually.
  They are just used by the other modules. But of course, you can compile them ('sbt compile') 
  and generate javadocs ('sbt doc')
  
  
  
- Projects using the Play framework can be run in development mode by running 'sbt run'.

- Projects using the Play framework can be packaged by running 'sbt dist'. The zipped package 
  which contains everything for distribution can then be found at the subfolder target/universal

    
- The following projects use Play: ImageWrapper, medspace, PdfWrapper, SqlWrapper


	
- There are some failed downloads:

jakarta-regexp (sources)
jakarta-regexp (docs)
rdf4j-core.jar  (sources)

But this downloads are not necessary for compilation.
Thus, this warnings can be ignored.
