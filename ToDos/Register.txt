Register:
- Wrappers are able to register/authenticate themselves; 
	Simple example: Send host name, list of available servies (as URLs) and a short description of the kind of wrapped data
- Wrappers can deregister themselves -> the 'clean' way
- If a wrapper doesn't respond for a certain while, a forced deregistration process will be started
- The Register has a datasource management module;

Register datasource management module:
- Communication is done with messages
- Message for registering a datasource 
- Message for deregistering a datasource 
- Message for forcing the deregisteration of a datasource (e.g. since it doesn't respond for a while)

Each Datasource wrapper is an actor itself, managing the network connection to a specific datasource-wrapper

Wrapper connection services:
- Call a service from a extern wrapper , e.g. check connectivity
-
