- Services of Dataspaces (Search and Query, especially keyword search)
- logical components
- sub dataspaces
- research challenges (e.g. LUA Introspection)

- Probabilistic mediated schemas
- Successive data integration/Pay-as-you-go fashion
- Research field in dataspaces is currently very active
- exisiting models suffer on a number of shortcomings
-> model for multimedia dataspaces
- dataspace views
- similarity relations 
- section about current state of dataspace realizations (-> it isn't realizable till now!)
 -> Mention current main challenges that have to be overcome
- Automatic creation of schema mappings (BootstrappingPay-as-you-goDataIntegrationSystems
