\textbf{Data source} A data source addresses an arbitrary data storage, whose data should be integrated in an information system. (\cite[p. 7]{DBLP:books/dp/LeserN2006}, own translation)

\textbf{Integrated or integrating information system} A integrated information system is an application, which facilitates the access to different data sources (\cite[p. 7]{DBLP:books/dp/LeserN2006}, own translation)

\textbf{Meta data} Meta data is data, which describes other data. To decide what is data and what is meta data in a system, is application dependant. Meta data has to be stored, browsed and integrated as well as 'normal' data. (\cite[p. 8]{DBLP:books/dp/LeserN2006}, own translation)
